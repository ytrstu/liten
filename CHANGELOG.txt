* report format changed
  - tab separated CSV
  - header repeated only once at file start
  - duplicate groups are separated by blank line

* API changed
  - 'action' callback parameter is removed from Liten constructor. Use 'handler'
    parameter with ActionsMixin subclass to alter remove() action logic
  - ActionsMixin not a parent, but a parameter to Liten class constructor.
    This allows to specify own behaviour for remove() and future actions
  - 'delete' parameter is removed from Liten() constructor - use ActionAutomatic
    handler for file deletion

  (P.S. ActionMixin is now a Strategy pattern for handling duplicates)
